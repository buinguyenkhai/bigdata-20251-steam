With that being said, this upgrade is a good value (skins are most certainly overpriced) as it nets you free skins which are otherwise very expensive AND 2400 premium currency to purchase the most expensive skins in the store.  If you love the game then you can’t go wrong with this."

Pros:
- Graphics are unbeatable and immersive
- The sound concept is unique!
- The gameplay feels real
- Player interactions are super cool with presets and voice-overs
- PVP is perfect: you can team up to take down Arc together... but not every encounter on the topside is trustworthy.
- Embark responds to player feedback and has created a masterpiece that none of the big development studios have ever managed to achieve.
- The Arc enemies are adjusted in strength to match the story of the game.
- Overall, by far the best game ever, in every respect. 

Cons:
- All the players who are clamoring for pure PVE... 

Please, Embark, don't let all the single-player gamers influence you negatively.

208556237,76561199120454851,english,True,True,0,0.5,2025-11-06 21:32:14,"First time playing an extract shooter and lemme tell you something this game is both accessible and challenging. There is just enough hand holding in the beginning to get you accustomed to the game in the tutorial. Then bang youre in a squad, and its kill or be killed, or call out that youre a friendly so that the enemy team hopefully doesnt fire on you. Its a very addicting game loop. Arc enemies at first seem so freaking imposing but once you learn their weakness, and learn better team tactics you can take them out ( so far the biggest thing ive taken out is a Bastion and a Leaper ). That doesnt mean they are easy to kill tho because the AI in the enemies is top notch. There have been so many PEAK CINEMA moments through my sessions, and the game get you heart racing. The cons i have with the game rn is that there is no recyclables tab to see all loot that can be recycled, and other small UI improvements that can be made. Other than that this game is awesome a great intro to extraction shooters."

While I'm not a fan of the MTX prices they have in the game, I've been earning raider tokens in-game at a fairly reasonable rate (I've earned about 600 in ~2 days). If it keeps up that way, I will be very appreciative.

If you're against the MTX aspect, I can also respect that. This doesn't give you any advantage whatsoever, and you'll miss nothing if you don't buy it."

You want to earn money selling skins in a game players have already paid for and i and many other players want cool designs.  

Some designs dont really tell you much exept ""a garbage man picked up a space helmet"" This is also a game where stealth is important so some wont picked the colorful ones that makes you glow like a radioactive pigeon that escaped chernobyl.


The visual design should be clear and simple. The players should see and understand exactly what the design is and what its meant to be.  Throw in a couple of good looking masks and helmet to cover up the ugly faces we cant change."

Arc Raiders is a solid game. The movement feels smooth, the gunplay is tight, and the sound design is excellent. Fighting and extraction moments are tense and enjoyable.

But the store is frustrating.

[h3]What’s good?[/h3]

[list]
[*]Gameplay is smooth and responsive.  
[*]Gunfights feel satisfying and sound great.  
[*]The world looks good and runs well.  
[*]Extraction gameplay is intense and rewarding.  
[/list]

[h3]What’s bad?[/h3]

[list]
[*]The game costs about $40, but cosmetics are priced $15 to $20 each, which is very expensive.  
[*]There’s no real way to earn Raider Tokens by playing normally—most content requires spending money.  
[*]The 500 free tokens given once don’t buy anything meaningful, which feels like a tactic to push purchases.  
[*]Community problems like exit camping and PvP toxicity make the experience worse.  
[/list]

[h3]Why does this matter?[/h3]

Players don’t expect everything for free. They want their time and effort to matter. Right now, the system seems to value money over playtime, which hurts the experience.

[h3]How can it be fixed?[/h3]

[list]
[*]Allow players to earn Raider Tokens steadily through challenges or milestones.  
[*]Offer one or two free cosmetics each month that can be unlocked by playing.  
[*]Reward loyal players with meaningful bonuses to show appreciation.  
[*]Be transparent about prices and how money supports the game—artists, servers, updates.  
[*]Consider adding an optional PvE-only mode to reduce toxicity and let players choose how to play.  
[/list]

[h3]Final thoughts[/h3]

Arc Raiders is a great game held back by a poor store model. The gameplay deserves praise, but the monetization undermines the experience. Fixing the economy and respecting players would make this game truly special.

Right now, it’s good, but the store is holding it back."

I dropped in expecting chaos, betrayal, and the usual “shoot on sight” gameplay. Instead, some enemy shared loot with me, others didn’t kill me when they could’ve and we both extracted together and made it out alive.

This is supposed to be a PvPvE extraction adventure, not a friendship simulator. I came here to suffer, not to be cared for.

Dont get Me wrong, the Core Gameplay Loop is Great but for a game which is Inspired so heavily on Nostalgia, for a Futuristic Extraction Looter Shooter there really is no personality for our Galactic Mercs as of now.

But here's a plea to the developers:  Please, please, pretty please with sugar on it, create a setting where you can limit match making to either microphones / voice *required* as well as refused.  If you don't want vocal interaction, you should be able to be matched with other players with the same desire.  

But if you really want to play with others that have voice installed, will be using it, want to communicate and work together through it, then you should be able to limit your pairing to those with voice.  You should also be able to specify a preference for language.

I don't think I've seen this before in a game, and it would make a huge difference.  I was paired with three different teams last night, and none of the other players spoke or responded to vocal interaction.  Total disappointment.

It's not a simple fix, but it would be worth it."

[b]EDIT[/b]: [i] (for the people that don't get what I'm saying) [/i] 
Digital pricing is always arbitrary to some degree since there’s no physical value behind it. But that’s kind of the baseline reality for all digital content (games, skins or even DLCs).

The way I looked at it is purely from a value-per-cost perspective: the Deluxe upgrade includes 2,400 coins, which already equals about €20 worth of in-game currency (if you check the in game store for a second). On top of that, you get the skins and other content included in the bundle.

[quote=0xCTRL] [b] So, if someone already plans to buy skins or cosmetics anyway, the Deluxe upgrade basically pays for itself[/b]. That’s why I called it a ‘solid deal’. [/quote]

Not because it’s objectively cheap, but because the math checks out compared to the in-game shop pricing."
