The game is cheap cheap.

The physics are bonkers and gives you the foundation for the best laughs!

Wanna move faster? Puff your cig!
Wanna get strong? Crack open a beer!
Wanna be a dick? Grab a cup of cold coffee, light a smoke and look at the others trying to get the RV unstuck, while giving them hindsight feedback.

Guaranteed good times!

Also, throwing a cigarette at landmines does nothing. (Don't quote me on that)

10/10 would buy again!"

The menu's also do not scream ""finished product"" either, being basic boxes that'd I'd expect from a beta build.

If this game were in Early Access right now, I would probably be more forgiving. But nope, this is a game that released without that buffer, without time to collect player suggestions and improvements. Even if it's £6.70 (~$8), the price does not excuse the poor gameplay that I'm actively fighting against.

Playing on controller is its own special hell. While driving the RV is actually reasonably good with a controller (even with the awkward manual gearbox), half the keybinds do not work as intended, and worse, oftentimes break unexpectedly, meaning for some parts of the gameplay, all I can do is pick items up and sit down, and I can't read the map because the game is confused on what button i'm pressing. And standing up forces me to press A, not Right Stick Click as the game prompts suggest.

The games's voice chat settings also reset after each restart, which is also annoying, forcing myself and friends to change the input option again to silence our voices because we had the audacity to use Discord to communicate.

As for performance, I have a reasonably good GPU (RX580 8GB) and performance floated around 45 - 75 FPS on high settings depending on what I was doing. The gameplay didn't feel too sluggish, and I'd argue the game isn't particularly badly optimised either (though more could be done).

I do think the game nails the vibe of an RV trip, and there's nothing wrong with the gameplay in of itself. It's just undermined by people who made it. I really hope the developers of the game find this review (and the discussions on their forum) and take to heart the complaints, because right now, the game is frustrating to interact with, and borderline unplayable in some cases. 

4.5/10 - Really solid idea marred by technical issues."

12 hours. That’s how long it took my partner and me to complete RV There Yet, and honestly it felt like the most gloriously chaotic cross-country vacation we’ve ever taken without needing to refill on gas or argue over who forgot the snacks.

From the moment we hit “Start Engine,” the game throws you into a delirious blend of co-op mayhem, road-trip nostalgia, and utter mechanical madness. Every mile of asphalt feels alive with possibility, or disaster. One minute you’re serenely gliding through a canyon sunrise, the next you’re dodging raccoons, managing RV plumbing emergencies, and screaming at your partner to “KEEP THE TEMPERATURE AT 72 OR WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE.”

The dynamic between players is pure magic. Whether you’re tag-teaming repairs on a sputtering engine or coordinating bathroom breaks like NASA mission control, the game captures the perfect mix of teamwork and total meltdown. It’s like Overcooked met Oregon Trail and decided to get weird in the best way possible.

The soundtrack? Straight-up Americana perfection. The visuals? So vivid you can practically smell the sunscreen and hear the faint hum of a generator. And the side quests? Let’s just say if you haven’t competed in a midwestern RV park chili cook-off while evading a tornado warning, you haven’t lived.

By the time the credits rolled, we were exhausted, euphoric, and genuinely emotional like we’d just completed a shared rite of passage.

Final Verdict:
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 5
RV There Yet isn’t just a game. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a test of love, patience, and your ability to parallel park under pressure. It’s the most fun you can have without actually blowing a tire.

Would I play it again?
Absolutely. Just let me restock the virtual burgers and brace for another round of glorious insanity."

The physics in the game are all over the place. The RV got destroyed at times because gravity would randomly remember it's a a thing and it would nosedive or it would just sit there bouncing and glitching all over the place and we'd have to restart. Driving was also a nightmare. 

You can have a game with ""looser"" physics and be fun and not expect much form the player or you can have a game that has more realistic physics and ask the player for more precise mobility. You can't have both and that's what this game does. Fundamentally, I can't recommend the game in this state as of the writing of this review.

Really, it's only fun with some friends for a time, but nothing else. Just not for me, I guess."

If the devs open up custom mapmaking or add additional campaigns, this will be a gem. Right now, it's a one and done release. So while it is a good time, the lack of replay-ability hurts this game overall. The main campaign is about 10 hours for someone who has never played.

My wife and I crossed a river on a moving platform, drove up a cliff, built a bridge out of planks, avoided a mine field, built and used a jank elevator that physics bounced us to the moon the first time and took all our resources to repair and try again, went off a massive ramp and jump, landed successfully, and then crashed 10ft from a checkpoint and got sent all the way back to the river.

I was willing to over look all of these annoyances because the concept of the game is interesting. However, the lack of check points means I would never recommend this game to anyone I like. You're stuck playing until you reach a check point or else you loose all progress since the last one. Many obstacles cause insta-death and will set you right back to an hour ago. In particular, the section with the ferry is way too long to go without a check point. The ferry physics are terrible (simply existing on the ferry can damage your RV). After the fiddly crossing, winding your way up a hill, removing landmines, repairing your vehicle and building a lift, you end up at the top of a giant ramp with one attempt to get it right or you will end up right back at the goddamn ferry.  At this point it's just annoying, not challenging."

also its four player despite having six seats in the van, kinda stupid, espescially since somehow the latest update broke all forms of multiplayer mods/plugins so it crashes your game after a little while no matter what

The game isn’t deep or unpredictable, but Ice Cube’s “tough guy trapped in a nightmare babysitting job” energy works surprisingly well, and the constant disaster humor keeps things moving. The kids start off obnoxious on purpose, but the story eventually lands in a sweet place about patience, trust, and chosen family. If you want something goofy, harmless, and easy to throw on for background laughs, it gets the job done. Don’t expect brilliance—expect Ice Cube fighting children and losing. 6.5/10."

First  the things that needs improving - 
1. if you are solo...the game is pretty boring, an ability to join random strangers would be great
2.the physics can get laggy and janky and glitchy, this should be addressed pretty much optimizing the game
3. Achievements, give us some achievements, they are always fun to do, and usually lead to extra exploring etc
4.  more than 1 map, preferably
5.  getting back into the rv...sucks, even jumping often doesnt work, I understand the people are hilariously short but srsly...let us get into the rv without having to grab a plank

this game is very fun especially with more people, no need to use dx12, just use dx11 with graphics like these dont bother cranking up the visual details be nicer to your cpu and gpu, and no this game doesnt use much of either.

The janky physics are charming as you winch your front and back ends up mountainsides, pulling yourself out of pits, listening to cassettes of some wild dude teach you meditation and Absolute Calm(tm).  We were all blown away by the end, calling it one of the best games we'd played together in a while.  A definite buy, and at $8 an absolute steal.

The RV entrance is an awkward height that is inconvenient to jump into, and the physics engine makes this even more annoying. I would frequently clip the stair at the bottom of my character model and hover in front.

Bumping into things seems to cause inconsistent or unrealistic damage to seemingly random parts of the RV.

Aggressive animals look poorly designed, can attack through the RV floor and walls, and run at slow nonthreatening paces that can be beaten on foot.

Several times during my short session a player would desync causing the RV to flail violently and loudly for that player.

The in game voice chat would be on when not highlighted or would not work at all.

The stamina system from peak was placed in this game quite shamelessly, which could be fine but it did not really serve much purpose. If you are going to use an idea from another game it should at the very least be transformative. Your stamina does not limit your ability to progress through the level, a regular health bar would've sufficed.

I played for less than an hour and experienced all this. I want the game to be a platform for fun with friends, i don't want fun with friends to be the crutch for the game.

It's a streamer game in a sense ofc, with 4 possible tiny pudgy dads in the RV, in game walkies and proximity voice chat, and many many ridiculous obstacles, but it delivers a more simulation focused experience than most other games in the stripe. 

The game keeps the focus on fun, not getting hung up too deep in some mechanics while swimming in others. It strikes a lovely balance where there are few wrong tools for a job. The winches on front and back of the RV could likely get you through the game alone. 

It's a deeper experience than it looks, but not deep enough to lose your interest. Smoking cigarettes and eating food has benefits beyond roleplaying, with stat boosts associated with each item. It is not a perfect game, and with the wrong friends I could see being miserable. 

It takes all of the best parts of being stuck on the side of the highway with a friend, and only brings enough of the boredom and frustration to make a compelling contrast. As a caveat, the game is intended as a multiplayer experience and likely doesn't feel the same alone. I can imagine a certain zen peace to that, but I haven't tried it.

You can play by yourself, but you will get bored quickly. This game requires your friends to help get this spectacular RV to the destination by going through a bunch of obstacles by either driving your way there, or winching your way up and down mountains.

Oh, and there are bears, snakes, and lot lizards!! j/k about lot lizards or am I? You and your friends need to get back home, and the best way to do it is working together or NOT! 

There are alot of exciting moments and great times as long as you have FRIENDS to help. Anyway, can you see that you need friends to make this game better!!!!

Have fun, and safe trips! hehehehe"

208913884,76561198419668734,english,True,True,0,0.5,2025-11-11 05:03:34,"RV There Yet? is a lighthearted and relaxing road-trip simulation game that captures the spirit of travel and exploration across scenic routes.

What I liked:
The art style is cheerful and colorful, which makes each destination feel inviting. The gameplay is simple but enjoyable — managing fuel, planning routes, and discovering landmarks keeps things engaging without being stressful. The soundtrack adds a pleasant, laid-back vibe that fits the theme of a family road trip perfectly.

What I disliked:
Some of the mechanics can feel repetitive after a while, especially if you prefer deeper management systems or faster pacing. A bit more variety in events and challenges along the road would make the experience more dynamic.

Recommendation:
If you enjoy casual travel-themed games or want something relaxing to unwind with, RV There Yet? is worth trying. It’s not a high-intensity or complex title, but it offers a cozy, feel-good experience that many players will appreciate.

The game's concept is beautiful and simple, the graphics are excellent, the size is ideal for a multiplayer game, and the price is affordable for players. However, I'd like to clarify  points:
 1- The game has limited activities; all you do is drive the vehicle and move around with one person helping you steer.

2- It's not suitable for more than two people because the game lacks meaningful roles. There are no significant roles for a third or fourth person other than laughing or sitting in the bathroom.

3- If there are more than four of you, the game requires modifications to the game files for this to work.

4- The game is full of bugs and stupid technical problems, such as getting under the car, flying inside the car if you're not attached to one of the guys, or even the car exploding due to the winch.

Ultimately, if you're playing alone, I recommend trying it. But if there are three or four of you, I absolutely do not recommend it."

The RV would get stuck on invisible things and break if the road was even slightly uneven. There are a few ""puzzles"" that seem like the game wants you to use environmental pieces to progress. Things like planks, ramps etc, but they almost never seem to work as intended and moving the items into place is very clunky. Maybe if the game has some reworks that address these issues I would be willing to purchase it again and play, but sadly as of right now its not worth it."
